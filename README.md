# Web-Scrape

The aim of this project is to scrape energy trade data from a web page and analyse the energy trade between companies/countries that took in place in 2015.

The results were visualised on a map with respect to the magnitude of the trade in TWh.

The link to the data source is "https://www.next-kraftwerke.com/knowledge/power-exchanges-list"
